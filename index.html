    <h2>Michael Hill</h2>
    <h3>His Story</h3>
     <p>Christopher Michael Hill, who goes by his middle name, “Michael,” is a 24-year-old pianist from Torrance, California. Michael began studying the piano when 
    he was 7 years old. When he was eighteen years old and applying for colleges, he originally planned to be a math major, but just as the deadline was going to pass, 
    his piano teacher convinced him to apply to for music. He then attended California State University, Long Beach, near his hometown, majoring in Piano Performance. 
    After obtaining his bachelor’s degree, he decided to continue his education in piano and was accepted into graduate school at The University of Oklahoma where he 
    will be graduating from in Spring 2022. He considers surviving graduate school to be his biggest accomplishment so far.</p>
	  <p>Michael is Christian and takes his faith very seriously. He’s been Christian for as long as he can remember, having been raised Christian, but it was in elementary 
    school that he accepted Jesus as his Lord and Savior. He has served the church all his life and continued to serve in college through clubs and fellowships. 
    Fittingly, he cites his favorite book as the Bible.</p>
	  <p>Some of Michael’s hobbies include going for walks, going to the movies, and traveling. He also loves to eat, and his favorite kinds of foods are Japanese and 
    Mexican food. Michael says that his greatest strength is to be friendly and inclusive, with friends and strangers alike. He explains his biggest weakness 
    as being difficulty with focusing and organization. The thing that he’s most likely to do when he needs to relax is listen to music, including bands 
    such as Muse and Radiohead.</p>
